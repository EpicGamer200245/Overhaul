### Testing Changes

* Daily Quests have been changed again but are still very unstable.
* Over-Throne still has the very good modifiers when you place a tower on the throne but doesn't give much monkey money or tokens on completion.
* Monkey Lab's token prices have decreased.
* Monkey Lab's upgrades can no go up to level 6 instead of level 5
* Pierce lab upgrade renamed and descriptions changed to be more in line of what it actually does.
* Big Bloon Sabotage's descriptions were changed to include new MOAB class bloons.
* Agent Shop order and prices has changed.
* Before some maps would require certain towers to be able to be unlocked and now those restrictions of needing a tower have been removed.
* The Ice Monkey before didn't work well and should now be more useful.
* The 3-0 Dart Monkey upgrade before was really bad and the 4-0 upgrade was way too pricey, it has now been changed for the 3-0 upgrade to be much better and the 4-0 is much cheaper but worse, overall I think the changes will help the tower.
* Fixed a bug where the Monkey Ace's pineapples countdown was incorrect so it was changed tojust explode in teh same amount of time as a normal exploding pineapple.
* Fixed a bug where the Dartling's Specialty Building's Level IV was giving Boomerang Monkeys 1 pierce instead of Dartling Gunners.
* Fixed a bug where you will get the Ground Stomp ability with Temple without the Ground Stomp upgrade.

## 0.04

### Key Details

* Overhauled Agent Shop
* Overhauled Reward Chest

### Key Changes

* Daily Quests are not included in this update because of unstability, it got fixed then without me changing it afterward editing another file broke it again. If I find a fix for it then I will include it in that update.
* The prices and order for everything in the agent shop has now been changed. The agents themselves haven't been changed.
* The reward chest starts off giving you 10 monkey money, but every 10 times you open it the amount of money it gives increases by 5 and every 3 times you will get a free agent, it will reset back to 10 when you get to the 555th reward, which also gives 560 monkey money, though I am not expecting anyone to get to that point.
* Fixed issues with getting too much monkey money from maps, all maps give 1.5x less monkey money now.

## 0.04 Testing

### Testing Details

* New tower: Super Monkey
* Overhauled Monkey Lab
* Overhauled Store
* Overhauled Specialty Buildings

### Testing Changes

* Super Monkey is very fast attacking, but im not sure if you will like it, your thoughts about it may be mixed.
* Monkey Lab now has a maximum upgrade level of 5, but is still good to use, most levels removed because Mastery is permanantly locked. Mastery is hard-coded to only allow you to get past with a specific number of Beginner maps won and we have map packs instead.
* The store is much less premium, nothing prices real money anymore and instead just monkey money and is pretty cheap.
* The specialist buildings should now have more of role in the game, if you have a strategy using 1 tower use their specialty, it will help quite a bit.
* Fixed issue with Quick Attack not giving more projectile cut off distance.

### Key Changes

* UI bug with the tower selection isn't possible to fix.
* Dart Monkey's Quick Attack still felt a bit too good for it's price, so it got nerfed and it's price for the buff should make sense.

## 0.03 Testing

### Testing Details

* New custom tower: Radar Monkey
* New custom bloon: Cyan Splitter
* Overhauled the Exploding Pineapple
* Tower avatars system overhauled
* New Map List
* Different Map Rewards
* New Leveling System
* New Tower List
* Overhauled the rounds

### Testing Changes

* The new Radar Monkey is very similar to the Monkey Sub's submerge and support upgrade just made into a tower.
* The new bloon Cyan Splitter is a very earlygame bloon, but it is also challenging, you will need pierce.
* The pineapple can now hit all bloon types, blows up in 2 seconds from 3, has a much bigger range, and prices more.
* The tower avatars system as it was before wouldn't match up with the custom towers and I decided that it wouldn't be worth it spending a lot of time to make the avatars work for the new towers and upgrades. The new system will have the tower icon there, but it will make the upgrade bar look more simple.
* The new map list is now split up into map packs that will still take a certain amount of badges or levels, but there are multiple maps from each difficulty in every map pack. There are also more secret maps that will unlock once you have gotten a certain tower.
* With the new map rewards Monkey Money is now more difficult to gain, but every map pack will have it's rewards have 20 more Monkey Money, for example: On Map Pack #1 you will get 120 Monkey Money for Easy, but at Map Pack #3 you will get 180 Monkey Money on Easy, and in Map Pack #4 you will get 210 Monkey Money on Easy.
* The leveling system for lower levels is much easier to get but I also extended leveling to level 555. The later levels in the 500s wont take millions of pops to get, most later levels will just take a bit of grinding.
* The tower list right now has a few flaws, the ui itslef doesn't extend to the bottom, but I am working on fixing that and a fix for it when it comes out of testing.
* All of the rounds up to round 50 have been changed, some to include Cyan Splitter, but overall each run on easy should now be much shorter.
* Many new balancing changes were made to the Tack Shooter, Dartling Gunner, and Dart Monkey.
* Tack Tower's name has been changed to Tack Shooter
