# Overhaul Changelog

---

## 0.04 Testing

### Testing Details

* New tower: Super Monkey
* Overhauled Monkey Lab
* Overhauled Store
* Overhauled Specialty Buildings

### Testing Changes

* Super Monkey is very fast attacking, but im not sure if you will like it, your thoughts about it may be mixed.
* Monkey Lab now has a maximum upgrade level of 5, but is still good to use, most levels removed because Mastery is permanantly locked. Mastery is hard-coded to only allow you to get past with a specific number of Beginner maps won and we have map packs instead.
* The store is much less premium, nothing costs real money anymore and instead just monkey money and is pretty cheap.
* The specialist buildings should now have more of role in the game, if you have a strategy using 1 tower use their specialty, it will help quite a bit.
* Fixed issue with Quick Attack not giving more projectile cut off distance.

## 0.03

### Key Changes

* UI bug with the tower selection isn't possible to fix.

## 0.03 Testing

### Testing Details

* New custom tower: Radar Monkey
* New custom bloon: Cyan Splitter
* Overhauled the Exploding Pineapple
* Tower avatars system overhauled
* New Map List
* Different Map Rewards
* New Leveling System
* New Tower List
* Overhauled the rounds

### Testing Changes

* The new Radar Monkey is very similar to the Monkey Sub's submerge and support upgrade just made into a tower.
* The new bloon Cyan Splitter is a very earlygame bloon, but it is also challenging, you will need pierce.
* The pineapple can now hit all bloon types, blows up in 2 seconds from 3, has a much bigger range, and costs more.
* The tower avatars system as it was before wouldn't match up with the custom towers and I decided that it wouldn't be worth it spending a lot of time to make the avatars work for the new towers and upgrades. The new system will have the tower icon there, but it will make the upgrade bar look more simple.
* The new map list is now split up into map packs that will still take a certain amount of badges or levels, but there are multiple maps from each difficulty in every map pack. There are also more secret maps that will unlock once you have gotten a certain tower.
* With the new map rewards Monkey Money is now more difficult to gain, but every map pack will have it's rewards have 20 more Monkey Money, for example: On Map Pack #1 you will get 120 Monkey Money for Easy, but at Map Pack #3 you will get 180 Monkey Money on Easy, and in Map Pack #4 you will get 210 Monkey Money on Easy.
* The leveling system for lower levels is much easier to get but I also extended leveling to level 555. The later levels in the 500s wont take millions of pops to get, most later levels will just take a bit of grinding.
* The tower list right now has a few flaws, the ui itslef doesn't extend to the bottom, but I am working on fixing that and a fix for it when it comes out of testing.
* All of the rounds up to round 50 have been changed, some to include Cyan Splitter, but overall each run on easy should now be much shorter.
* Many new balancing changes were made to the Tack Shooter, Dartling Gunner, and Dart Monkey.
* Tack Tower's name has been changed to Tack Shooter
